In this repo, I put a concept image generator that was in my head since 2021, and now that's alive here, think like a true table or something like this.
Every pixel in an image has limited colors and the image has limited pixels, for example:

A full HD image has 1920 in width and 1080 in height, so there's 2,073,600 pixels in this image.

If we use all 256 colors in RGB, there's 256Ë†3 colors, equals to 16,777,216 possible colors in each pixel.

This generator is a concept because there's 1.5e14981179 possible images in 1920x1080 resolution.

Since this generates every image possible in this resolution, it will make a perfect image of a monkey studying quantum physics in the middle of the Broadway, NYC. Also every frame of Finding Nemo, but instead of clown fish, it is a goldfish.

NOTE: This is a concept, maybe one day we can use this with an AI to search for the generated images.
